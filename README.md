### üíª CCTHESS2_THESIS_2

#### Welcome to the repository for my CCTHESS2_THESIS_2 project! This project is part of my thesis for the subject CCTHESS2 (Computer Science Thesis 2). Please reach out to me first before steal anything from this repo ideas!!
This is continuation for my Thesis 1

## üíª Description
The CCTHESS2_THESIS_2 project aims to [briefly describe the objective and purpose of your thesis project]. It focuses on [mention the key areas or functionalities your project covers]. The goal of this project is to [explain the expected outcome or contribution of your thesis project].

## üíª Proof-of-concept
1. **Artificial Inteligence + Biology**

2. **BioInformatics** This mostly what I want but I need to talk with some Professor if this is the best approach to deal with in my solo thesis proposal

3. **ChemTech** I mean Chemical Technology with some Laboratory expedition need required if I'm going to go with this one

4. **Decentralized Artificial Intelligence**
   
Best thesis/research? üòÖ
